== Description ==

Our story began in 1924 when Dr Lorna Hodgkinson, a remarkable Australian of great dedication and vision, established the Sunshine Institute. Lorna was the first woman to receive a Doctorate at the prestigious Harvard University, USA. As a teacher herself, Lorna was passionate in her belief that people with an intellectual disability should be supported to lead meaningful lives.
